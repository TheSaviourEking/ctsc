                    <p className="Autism-text-description mt-5">
                        Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a serious developmental
                        condition affecting communication and social interaction abilities.
                        ASD is characterized by differences in brain development, leading to
                        unique behaviors such as overreacting to stimuli, difficulty
                        understanding others' emotions, sensitivity to sounds, and repetitive
                        behaviors.
                    </p>
                    <p className="Autism-text-description mt-5 fst-italic">
                        Lack of awareness about autism can lead misunderstanding and
                        mistreatment, as individuals may mistakenly attribute behaviors to
                        intentional misbehavior rather than recognizing them as symptoms of
                        autism.

                    <p className="Autism-text-description mt-5">
                        Autism spectrum disorder typically begins before the age of three (3)
                        and may persist throughout life, with symptoms often appearing within
                        the first 12 to 24 months. Adolescents and young adults with autism
                        may struggle with social interactions, communication, and
                        understanding appropriate behavior, often requiring support from
                        healthcare providers due to co-occurring conditions like anxiety or
                        depression.

                    <p className="Akwa-ibom-designer-text-description mt-5">
                        This is one of the major reasons why every individual in the world
                        needs to have an idea of autism. Due to ignorance, some parents,
                        teachers, and adults have severely punished autistic children
                        struggling with tasks like math or reading. Lacking the understanding
                        of autism and the appropriate treatment is not cute or an excuse in
                        2024 anymore.

                        Today, at Cracking the Style Code, we asked members of our society
                        what they know about autism. This survey explores the progress made in
                        raising awareness about autism since its inception. Autism awareness
                        isn't for medical professionals alone, understanding autism is
                        essential for everyone in our society.

                        Unfortunately, many people had zero knowledge about autism. Some
                        mentioned never having heard of autism before, while others were
                        unsure of its meaning. Only two individuals provided detailed
                        explanations of what they believe autism means.

                        I think that autism is a disease that makes people not understand
                        themselves or their surroundings. They behave strangely to the people
                        around them and this behavior is not usually intentional.

                        Autistic people tut or make ticking sounds sometimes to keep
                        themselves busy. I saw a video of an autistic girl and she scratches
                        and beats herself often. She is unable to control these actions even
                        if they hurt her. She also uses vulgar words when she speaks with
                        people around her. In that video, the people around the girl did not
                        act negatively to her behavior because they know she is autistic.

                        I think that autism is a disease that makes people behave as if they
                        have a mental disorder. It is a defect in the brain that affects a
                        person’s behavior. They are not mentally impaired, but they sometimes
                        exhibit the behavior of a mentally unstable person because they
                        usually seem to create and live in their world. I used to have a
                        classmate who behaved this way. He always did things differently to
                        others - making a sound that was not rhythmical with his pen—other
                        times, hallucinating and conversing with someone that isn’t present.
                        Initially, I never knew what such behavior was called. It was after I
                        described my classmate to a friend that my friend told me about
                        autism. Apart from this, they usually suffer from depression and
                        loneliness, and they think low of themselves.

                            From the street conversations we had with Akwa-Ibom people, it simply means that more awareness campaigns need
                            to be carried out to get people to know about autism, and how autistic people should be better treated.
